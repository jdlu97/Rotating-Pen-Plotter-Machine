# Term Project Proposal

 **Project Description**
 
 We intend to design a ______ . It would have a circular base that rotates around its center (one axis) and a marker that draws a picture on the glass. The marker is fixed on a holder and its motion is accomplished by two axes. One axis is created by the motion of a lead screw that is actuated by a motor. The second, half-axis is an "in/out" motion by a solenoid.
 
 The motors and the solenoid are connected to the STM32 Nucleo MCU which acts as the CPU and runs a program that implements the logic needed to accomplish the task.
 
 A way to feed the graphics of the picture or drawing into our program (input) will be implemented as suggested by the term project instructions.
