# Term Project Proposal

 **Project Description**
 
 We intend to design an automatic pen drawer to be used with pint glasses. It would have a circular base that rotates around its center (one axis) and a marker that draws a picture on the glass. The marker is fixed on a holder and its motion is accomplished by one and a half axes. One axis is created by the motion of a lead screw that is actuated by a motor. The other axis, half-axis is an "in/out" motion by a solenoid.
 
 The motors and the solenoid are connected to the STM32 Nucleo MCU which acts as the CPU and runs a program that implements the logic needed to accomplish the task.
 
 A way to feed the graphics of the picture or drawing into our program (input) will be implemented as suggested by the term project instructions.
 
 **Bill of Materials**
 
 A breakdown of the cost for the individual components that make up the project is shown below. The rough estimate of the total cost is slightly above $70.

 **Concept Sketch**
 
 A model of the concept design with labeled components is shown below (**Figure 1**). The pint glass is used as implicit reference dimension. A typical pint glass is about 6-inch tall with a mean diameter of 3-inches. Based on this, we assume that the overall dimensions of the assembly would be around 6-inches in length and width as well as 7-8 inches tall.
